Normally, the list should auto-update from orchid, but it doesn't work? Can add papers manually by supplying the dot

Open _data/source.yml

# To add a new paper:
* Add a new line as:
"- id: doi:"
* Add the image to represent the paper: next line, then double space, then path to the image (here it should be images/papers/filename.jpg)
