The first symbiosis to be discovered were lichens. Lichens consist of multiple unrelated lineages of microbes: different fungi, unicellular algae, and bacteria. Together – and only together – they can form elaborate three-dimensional bodies, which look nothing like individual symbionts. Our research focuses on the functional and taxonomic diversity of lichen symbionts and the give-and-take of symbionts into the common outcome. We are interested in several topics:

Lichen bodies consist of multiple organisms that grow together. How do symbionts recognize each other when the symbiosis is established? How do they interact as the symbiosis grows and develops? What mechanisms allow them to create multicellular structures?
